# Genetic Algorithm to Determine the Optimal Order of Defeating Bosses in Elden Ring

This project uses a genetic algorithm to simulate an "ant" navigating a series of enemies, represented as points on a map, to achieve a specific goal. The main objective is to find the most optimal or fit path through the enemies in the game "Elden Ring".

## Features

- **Visualization**: Uses the `tkinter` library for visualization.
- **Data Input**: Reads enemy data from an Excel file named "bussy.xls".
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Simulates the movement of ants through a series of enemies on a map, aiming to find the most optimal or fit path.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required libraries:
     ```
     pip install tkinter xlrd
     ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   - Simply execute the Python script:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
